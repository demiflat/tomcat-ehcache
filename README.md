##### This project shows how to configure a simple servlet to run on Tomcat in Kubernetes with distributed session replication and Ehcache/Terracotta

###### Configurations:
 - [src/main/resources/ehcache.xml](src/main/resources/ehcache.xml)
  
This is the servlet Ehcache implementation basic configuration file. Not distributed, test only [^1]

 <!-- - [src/main/resources/ehcache.distributed.xml](src/main/resources/ehcache.distributed.xml)  -->
 - [terracotta/tc-cluster.cfg](terracotta/tc-cluster.cfg) 

This is the test Terracotta server configuration file. [^2]

#### Running make will list build targets

- DOCKER_REGISTRY 

Define environment variable $DOCKER_REGISTRY for the container registry used.

###### Local testing/Cluster testing tools

- [tc.local](tc.local)

This runs a local Terracotta server for development testing after downloading and extracting the artifacts in [terracota/download.sh](terracota/download.sh)

- [tc.activate](tc.activate)
  
Before the Terracotta server can be used, it must first be activated! [^3]

After activation it goes from this state:
```log
2023-06-01 00:05:31,938 INFO - Moved to State[ DIAGNOSTIC ]
```
To this state:
```log
2023-06-01 00:05:55,299 INFO - Moved to State[ ACTIVE-COORDINATOR ]
```
The test config is sufficient to configure caches for testing.

- [cli.newsession](cli.newsession)
  
This calls the server at $TARGET (default localhost) to create a new session

- [cli](cli)

After a session is created, this call the server at $TARGET (default localhost) to continue to use the session created previously.

#### Kubernetes deployments
[k8s/k8s-role.yaml](k8s/k8s-role.yaml)

[k8s/k8s-deployment.yaml](k8s/k8s-deployment.yaml) 
Kubernetes deployment, set to create 3 replicas for testing.[^4]

[k8s/k8s-ingress.yaml](k8s/k8s-ingress.yaml) 
Kubernetes ingress, used to expose deployment externally.[^5]
